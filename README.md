# Holodeck

> "Computer, end program!" ...or don't. Your choice.

Welcome to the Holodeck, a place to simulate conversations between anyone you can imagine. Ever wondered what Jean-Luc Picard, Duke Leto, and Amelia Earhart would talk about? Me too.

This project is inspired by those wonderful moments in Star Trek where characters would run historical simulations on the holodeck. Here, you can define `Actor` personalities, place them in a `Conversation`, and watch the fun unfold.

## How it works

1.  **Define your Actors**: Create an `Actor` and give them a name and a personality. You can find examples in the `/personalities` folder.
2.  **Start a Conversation**: Kick things off with a starter prompt.
3.  **Let them talk**: The actors will take turns responding to each other, powered by AI.
4.  **Interject!**: You can inject your own messages into the conversation to steer it in new directions.

## What's next?

Right now, conversations are turn-based. The next major step is to build a real-time chat interface so you can interject whenever your heart desires, just like a proper holodeck experience.
